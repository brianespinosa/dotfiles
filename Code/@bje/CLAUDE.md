# @bje - BJE Enterprise

This directory contains repositories for the **bje** GitHub enterprise (billing contact `b@bje.co`).
It is a personal enterprise used to consolidate several orgs and projects under one roof so
management, policy, and automation are shared across many repositories.

Unlike `@momentive_emu`, this enterprise is **not** an EMU with a separate managed user. Membership
is held by the normal personal `brianespinosa` account, so credentials are inherited from the root
`~/Code/.envrc` and no enterprise-level `.envrc` exists here.

## Orgs

| Org directory      | GitHub org       | Notes                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@bje-settings/`   | `bje-settings`   | Enterprise and org configuration as code (`terraform`)     |
| `@bje-co/`         | `bje-co`         | Primary org (`blocks`, `bje.co`, `cm`, `.github`)          |
| `@bork-ltd/`       | `bork-ltd`       | No repos yet                                                |
| `@arsenalamerica/` | `arsenalamerica` | Arsenal America; has its own `.envrc` for `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` |

## Directory Structure

Org directories use the `@` prefix and match the GitHub org login exactly, the same convention as
`@momentive_emu`. When cloning a repo for org `bje-co`, the target path is
`@bje/@bje-co/<repo-name>`.

Orgs with no repos still get a directory so the enterprise layout stays complete and clone targets
are obvious.

## Migration from `@brianespinosa`

Most repos currently under `~/Code/@brianespinosa/` (the personal user namespace) are expected to
move into an org inside this enterprise over time. Forks are the likely exception -- they stay on
the personal user account. When a repo is transferred, move the local checkout to the matching
`@bje/@<org>/` directory rather than leaving it under `@brianespinosa/`.

## Configuration as code

`@bje-settings/terraform` manages enterprise and org GitHub settings with the
`integrations/github` Terraform provider, state in HCP Terraform, applies in GitHub
Actions. Org settings, Actions policy, custom properties, and org rulesets are managed
there rather than through the GitHub UI. `bje-co` is not yet covered.

## Enterprise rulesets

Three rulesets defined at the enterprise level apply to repos in every org. They are **not**
managed in terraform today (the `org-baseline` module defines an optional org-level
`default_branch_ruleset`, but nothing covers enterprise rulesets); they were created in the
GitHub UI.

| Ruleset (id)                                     | Target | Enforcement | Effect                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protect main (21295778)                          | branch | active      | Blocks deletion and force pushes on the default branch; requires a PR (0 approvals; merge/squash/rebase all allowed) |
| Code Coverage (21882789)                         | branch | active      | Requires 95% minimum code coverage, no max-drop limit                                                                 |
| Enterprise Custom Agent Configuration (21295581) | push   | disabled    | No effect while disabled                                                                                              |

Orgs and repos layer additional rulesets on top (e.g. the `bje-co` org ruleset "Protect default
branch" adds copilot code review; `arsenalamerica/app` repo rulesets add required status checks
and a required Preview deployment).

Inspecting rulesets with `gh`:

- `gh api orgs/<org>/rulesets` lists everything applying to an org, including enterprise-sourced
  rulesets (`source_type: Enterprise`).
- `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rules/branches/<branch>` shows the effective merged rules for a
  branch, with each rule's source.
- Enterprise-level endpoints (`gh api enterprises/bje/rulesets`) need the `admin:enterprise`
  scope, which the normal gh session does not carry. Full conditions and targeting of enterprise
  rulesets are only readable there or in the UI.

## GitHub Credentials

Inherited from `~/Code/.envrc` (personal `brianespinosa` account, `~/.config/gh/personal`). No
per-enterprise override. `@arsenalamerica/.envrc` uses `source_up` and only adds Vercel config; it is
stowed from `@brianespinosa/dotfiles-private`.
